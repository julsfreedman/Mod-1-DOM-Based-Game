This is my version of the classic Memory Game that I loved to play as a child and still do to this day.  This game is also known as Match Game, Concentration, Matching Pairs, and Match Up in the United States. This front end game will be written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js. It will be styled using the CSS Flexbox Layout. 

The object of the game is to turn over the most pairs of matching cards and you win the game.  If you are playing alone then your goal would be to turn over all of the matching pairs until all of the cards have been matched.  Each player turns over one card at a time and tries to remember, or guess, where its match is and turn over that card.  If they are correct, they get another turn.  If they are incorrect, then it is the next player's turn. The games ends when all pairs have been found and the player with the most pairs wins.  Although there is no rule for the number of players, the group will want to keep the number of players to a minimum as there will only be "X"(//I have not decided yet but probably 12 or 16) number of cards total in this online game. 

I am going to personalize this memory game with a theme of Fungi, or mushrooms. I am hoping to add educational text along with the pictures of each mushroom, so the players might learn something while having fun. This is a personal intrest of mine that I'm always learning more about and recently began the fun hobby of mushroom foraging. Besides the obvious, which is the delicious umami taste and the essential nutrients that various mushrooms add to our diet, fungi are also used for various medicinal purposes for both mental and physical ailments. They are an essential decomposer in the ecosystem helping to sustain Earth and fighting the impacts of climate change. Researchers are proposing a form of tree fungus as a possible defense against biochemical weapons and they might even help to save our planet from pollution!
