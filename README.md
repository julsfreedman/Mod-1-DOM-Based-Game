HTML / CSS / JavaScript

**Background**

This is my version of the classic Memory Game that I loved to play as a child and still do to this day. This game is also known as Match Game, Concentration, Matching Pairs, and Match Up in the United States. This front end game will be written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js. It will be styled using the CSS Flexbox Layout.

The object of the game is to find the matching cards. The player wins when they find all 8 matches. Player turns over one card at a time and tries to remember, or guess, where its match is and turn over that card. The games ends when all pairs have been found. Player can hit the reset button if they would like to play again.

I am going to personalize this memory game with a theme of Fungi, or mushrooms. This is a personal interest of mine that I'm always learning more about and recently began the fun hobby of mushroom foraging. Besides the obvious, which is the delicious umami taste and the essential nutrients that various mushrooms add to our diet, fungi are also used for various medicinal purposes for both mental and physical ailments. They are an essential decomposer in the forest ecosystem helping to sustain Earth and fighting the impacts of climate change. Researchers are proposing a form of tree fungus as a possible defense against biochemical weapons and they might even help to save our planet from pollution! Fungi have more in common with information technology than one would ever imagine. In analogy to the "World Wide Web", fungi form a large underground network in forest soils that has been coined "The Wood Wide Web." Just as humans interact via social media, trees secretly communicate with each other underground through a network of fungi and bacteria forming a vast interconnected web of organisms!
